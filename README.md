## About The Project

**Climate Sync** was born from a simple idea: your schedule and the weather are deeply connected. Why check two different apps to plan your day? This project integrates weather forecasts directly into your personal calendar, providing a clear, contextual view of the conditions for your upcoming events.

Whether you're planning a weekend hike, a business trip, or just your daily commute, Climate Sync provides the foresight you need. By fetching weather data for the specific time and location of each calendar event, it enables smarter planning and preparation.

This project was developed by **Team Aurora** as part of the project blueprint dated October 30, 2025.
